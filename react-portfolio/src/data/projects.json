    "description": "Developed a robust technique to detect GAN-generated images by identifying unique artifacts that are not typically present in authentic images. Applied Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to the RGB channels of images to extract frequency domain features. Leveraged a neural network to classify images based on these features, effectively highlighting distinct patterns of GAN-generated content",
